[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Exercise 2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

Answer: The Pmf looks way wrong, but according to the text: "PMFs work well if the number of values is small. But as the number of values increases, the probability associated with each value gets smaller and the effect of random noise increases."

Therefore, the pmf shows us how great the noise is in our data, and to correct this we could bin the data on a set of ranges of values to clean things up. The Cdf should be immune to the noise.
Also, as the CDF displays a nearly linear distribution it implies a uniform distribution indicative of a random variable selection.
To qoute the book as well: "That outcome might be non-obvious, but it is a consequence of the way the CDF is defined. What this figure shows is that 10% of the sample is below the 10th percentile, 20% is below the 20th percentile, and so on, exactly as we should expect."


```python

import random
import thinkstats2 as t2
import thinkplot as tp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

random_list = [random.random() for x in range(1000)]
tp.PrePlot(2)
rand_pmf = t2.Pmf(random_list)
tp.Pmf(rand_pmf)
plt.show()
tp.PrePlot(2)
rand_cdf = t2.Cdf(random_list)
tp.Cdf(rand_cdf)
tp.Config(xlabel='Percentile rank', ylabel='CDF')    
plt.show()
```
